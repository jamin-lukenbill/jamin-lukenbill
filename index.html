So you decided to learn guitar, great decision.I am confident that this will be a great decision for you. and become a hobby and source of enjoyment.
that you will enjoy for the rest of your life. <br> <br>
however right now I'm sure that you are disapointed, with your fingers tired and hurting not changeing chords fast enough and haveing a hard time 
remembering the notes. And I was tired of it too until I could find and play songs that I had heard before. And then I could start enjoying what I 
had heard people say about learning an instrament. And your friends and family will find out you play guitar they will ask for you to "play something" 
and these songs will help you out. with that all these songs will be on a free app ultimate guitar and will be found on the internet. I hope you take the time to play them well.
