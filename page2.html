This song was the first song I really got to play well and sing with. and I am sure you will to.
First this song has a capo which are less then ten dollers so you can spare the change.
But the capo provides a nice feeling to the song that makes it unique. The strumming pattern is  
the most important thing because it makes the songs rythem recognizeable and sounds better the difference between a good
guitarist and a decent one is the  skill of the rythem. I truly recomend this song for your first because it is simple with
the chords and the only challenge I could imagine you haveing istrouble with the strumming pattern however practice will solve this song
